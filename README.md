Why do I feel compelled to post a response to this article ??
How can we expect the net to arrive at a consensus about matters of taste ??

Given the author's disinterest in lyrics and dislike for rock vocals, his
suggestion that we do away with rock lyrics altogether is quite rational.

However, for me, lyrics are part of the soul of song, whether the song be
rock'n'roll, broadway ballad, or art song.  I can list many rock'n'roll and pop
songs that I enjoy for the lyrics, or choruses, as much as for the music --

        Black Sabbath's                 Paranoid
        Neil Diamond's                  Turn on Your Heart Light
        Jackson Browne's                Lawyers in Love
        Bruce Springsteen's             Born to Run /and/ Born in the USA
        Elton John's                    Sad Songs Say So Much
        Eddie Grant's                   Electric Avenue
        Thomas Dolby's                  Blinded By Science
        Led Zeppelin's                  Over the Hills and Far Away

as well as many songs that have lyrics which seem mindless or like they were
thrown together for effect,  e.g., the "Archie's" "Sugar Sugar" and Aretha
Franklin's "Freeway of Love" (cf. "Respect").  But even "Freeway of Love"
can be viewed as part of a long tradition of bawdy ballad, and some people
may appreciate the song for all that.

If someone had advocated doing away with song lyrics in the forties, on the
grounds that
    -   you only needed the music to dance, anyway
        -   most lyrics being written were fluff, and people needed serious
                music to elevate their minds  (beginning to sound like Plato, eh?)
well, maybe we wouldn't have had some powder puffs like "Wing and a Prayer"
(though I'm sure that this song was meaningful to many people, as well),
but, then, we wouldn't have had "Serenade in Blue" (whose lyrics I enjoy!)
"Stardust" (whose lyrics Fred Flinstone enjoyed! ["that fuzzy-wuzziness, that
ring-a-ding-a-ding" ... ).  And on and on ....

Also, some people LIKE ragged voices.  I, for one, enjoy listening to both Neil
Diamond AND Neil Young.  I often enjoy listening to singers who can convey
enthusiasm and emotion, even if it sometimes sounds like they're singing in
spite of their voice!  Does anyone out there remember Rod Stewart's rendition
of "You Wear it Well"?

To the three or four of you who read this far:  thanks for putting up with
my emoting like this.  *I* don't want to forget about lyrics, and I hadn't
seen anyone else say so, yet.

P.S.:  By the way, fiddle playing was condemned by 19th century churches
because it stirred up the blood and incited people to lustful thoughts.

Pagannini, I believe, was the great violinist who was rumored to be "in
league with the devil", because of how he could stir people with his
fiddle playing?  And the author of the fiddle tune "Devil's Dream"?

P.P.S:  I don't understand why we're hearing so much about rock'n'roll's
glorification of (premarital, I presume) sex but little regarding the
glorification of adultery in C&W.

     Consider Ravel's "Bolero".  This is piece that is primarily repetitious.
It is also very popular (thanks to Bo Derek?).

     The rock group War used repetition of lyrics extensively.  Songs like
"Gypsy Man" and others that I can't remember names for demonstrate this.
I don't know what there point was, but I liked their music.

     Disco music is quite repetitive.  This makes it an excellent candidate
for jazz dance numbers.
